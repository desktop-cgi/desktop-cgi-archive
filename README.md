# desktop-cgi
Desktop-CGI is a desktop executable app that is created using electron, nodejs express based server that serves - CGI files (PHP, Ruby, Python, Perl, Other Interpreted Languages), CGI / Interpreted language apps through embedded webservers (PHP, Ruby, Python, Perl, JSP, ASPX, Other Interpreted Languages), or remote proxy webserver apps (any) 


# Features

    Electron based express application that runs Node - Express based application that runs CGI files or CGI web apps that can be served from an file, an embedded web server using proxy, or an remote proxy web server


# Usage

* Install node.js from [https://www.nodejs.com](https://www.nodejs.com)
* Clone the Git repository (Alternatively, download the git repository)
* `cd` (change directory) into the git repository folder
* Run command `npm install`
* Install electron packager
    - [electron-packager](https://github.com/electron/electron-packager): `npm install -g electron-packager`
* Add your application in the respective `www` folder
* Check and modify `config.json` file for your application's configuration needs

* Run command `npm run electronbuild`


# Functionality Details


##### Electron based Desktop application that runs CGI Server

* Run any script files that support CGI based file script serving
* Run any host that serves a web app using proxy 
    - In App / Local / Remote proxy support
* Allows embedding servers to server apps behind a CGIJS proxy server
* Allows
    - running multiple interpreters in one app
    - running multiple proxies in one app
    - multiple embedded servers in one app
* Nodejs framework independent / agnostic for app development
    - Express Recommended (used for demo)


##### The script will pipe all interpreted language files below:

* Python (2.x, 3.x)
* Perl (Version Independent)
* PHP (Version Independent)
* Ruby (Version Independent)
<!-- * JSP (Version Independent) -->


##### The script will pipe all proxies of above languages and following:

* Jsp (With Tomcat embedded)
* Aspx (Version Independent - With local IIS proxy, Apache embedded)
* Any app using local / remote proxy


##### The script currently allows embedding following servers for proxy [TODO: In Development]:

* Apache HTTPD (Allows Embed & Proxy)
* Apache TomCat (Allows Embed & Proxy)
* Nginx (Allows Embed & Proxy)
* Mongoose (Allows Embed & Proxy)

The script an proxy to any server even IIS (Allows Proxy) , Other embedded servers or Proxy-able local/remote servers


##### Note:


##### Package Dependencies:

* Library dependencies:
    - Nodejs: (> 8.x)

* Application Dependencies:
    - cgi-js: (>=1.0.0)


##### Usage Demo:

Check `index.js` and `server` folder for demo code
