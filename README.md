# Highlights


Desktop-CGI can serve any CGI files or CGI / Scripted / Interpreted languages like PHP, Ruby, Python, Perl, JSP, ASPX, Other Interpreted Languages through embedded webservers or any remote proxy webserver apps 


Desktop-CGI runs an Electron - Node - Express based application under the hood and supports major Operating systems like Windows, Linux, Mac or any operating systems supported by Electron.


# Usage

* Install node.js from [https://www.nodejs.com](https://www.nodejs.com)
* Clone the Git repository (Alternatively, download the git repository)
* `cd path/to/desktop-cgi-folder` (change directory) into the git repository folder from command line / shell / powershell
* Run command `npm install`
* Install electron packager
    - [electron-packager](https://github.com/electron/electron-packager): `npm install -g electron-packager`
* Add your application in the respective `www` folder
* Check and modify `config.json` file for your application's configuration needs
* Check if your electron app runs using command `npm run electron`
* Run command `npm run electronbuild`


# Functionality Details


##### Electron based Desktop application that runs CGI Server

* Run any script files that supports CGI based file script serving - using `cgijs` file module
* Run any host that serves a web app - using `cgijs` proxy 
    - In App / Local / Remote proxy support
* Allows embedding servers like httpd, nginx, etc to serve web applications - using `cgijs` process module
* Allows
    - running multiple interpreters in one app
    - running multiple proxies in one app
    - multiple embedded servers in one app
* Allows 
* `cgijs` is Nodejs framework independent / agnostic for serving CGI or interpreted scripting apps via files, or server based web apps via proxies
    - Express Recommended and used for demo


##### The script will pipe all interpreted language files below:

* Python (2.x, 3.x)
* Perl (Version Independent)
* PHP (Version Independent)
* Ruby (Version Independent)
<!-- * JSP (Version Independent) -->


##### The script will pipe all proxies of above languages and following:

* Jsp (With Tomcat embedded)
* Aspx (Version Independent - With local IIS proxy, Apache embedded)
* Any app using local / remote proxy


##### The script should currently allow embedding following servers for proxy [TODO: In Development]:

* Apache HTTPD (Allows Embed & Proxy)
* Apache TomCat (Allows Embed & Proxy)
* Nginx (Allows Embed & Proxy)
* Mongoose (Allows Embed & Proxy)

The script can proxy to any File or most embeddable servers or Proxy-able local/remote servers; even IIS (Allows Proxy)


##### Note:


##### Package Dependencies:

* Library dependencies:
    - Nodejs: (> 8.x)

* Application Dependencies:
    - cgi-js: (>=1.0.0)


##### Usage Demo:

Check `index.js` and `server` folder for demo code
